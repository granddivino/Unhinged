App Title: Uninged: A Day in the Life of a Karen

App Demo: https://granddivino.github.io/Unhinged/

Concept:
It's a short game with many paths. The concept is to be a text based game with a bit of inspiration drawn from
"Choose Your Own Adventure". There's not really an objective just to have fun with it and see how many different endings
you can get based on the choices you make by being a horrible person. There's no actual win scenario but there is technically
win logic (best ending, middle, worst).

Technologies Used:
HTML
CSS
JavaScript

Approach:

Overview
I knew that the game I wanted to do was a "Choose Your Own Adventure" based off of the books I remember checking out at
the library as a kid. From what I can remember, there was alwasy a scenario, then a question, and two paths. So when I 
was thinking about my approach to the design I tried to stay true to that in some way even though it hardly looks like a
book. The idea was to have the same setup. 

Wireframe:
(Not really sure what to put here since I didnt draw one out beforehand)

Heading at the top
Div below the heading for the questions and scenarios
Two even divs at the bottom for the choices

Color Pallet:
(Just used basic ones, none of the RGB)
 green
 yellow
 black
 pink

User stories:
As a user I definitely appreciate good content and user friendly games. If it seems pretty straightforward, it's good to me.

Development Plan:

I designed all of my scenarios first, each scenario has a question, and then there's always 2 choices. I wanted to make
more choices, but for times sake and not to have dozens of paths to code, I made two total for each.
Based on the choice you make, you earn points. The points you earn determine what type of 
ending you will get. After planning out all of the content, I did the coding, which was the most time consuming part and
getting it to work as intended. Lastly, the images added for each choice and overall aesthetic was designed. It was not 
meant to look great, just to work properly.

Development Plan ONE: Brainstormed scenarios and choices and researched "Karen"
Development Plan Two: Coding (the longest part) and testing to work properly
Development Plan Three: CSS and revise code as needed
Development Plan Four: More testing and cleanup

MVP: 

MVP ONE: Working game but not styled
MVP Two: Working game with some fixes of minor bugs again
MVP Three: Working game with some fixes of minor bugs and styling
MVP Four: Complete working game (and hopefully didn't miss anything)

Stretch goals:

Stretch goals ONE: To have a wireframe and scenarios laid out
Stretch goals Two: To lay out idea for what I want the code to be
Stretch goals Three: Start the coding and get as far as I can and revise, edit, and add code as needed
Stretch goals Four: Complete working game

Challenges:

HTML and CSS were no problem, but it definitely refreshed my memory on it and definitely solidified my
proficiency. Even learned a few new things from googling things I wanted to implement. The biggest challenge 
was ALL of the javascript. This has been a huge fear of mine since starting learning it in class, working on my
own and getting it to work. But after a lot of frustration, googling, and working through it all I definitely
feel more accomplished in my understanding. 95% of my time spent on this was devoted to the coding and the rest 
to CSS.
